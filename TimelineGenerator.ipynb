      " I'm available, you know, I look at them. Yeah. What else? Anybody have any questions on this? There are a lot of websites that will make each timeline for you. Just, you know, if you really do pick one of those, just make sure it looks nice. Yeah. Let me, let me just wrap it over. Okay, and just to remind you of the example on the website at the 20 seconds. So lots of stuff becoming, uh, it's the wrong class. Here it is. So the last class I was talking about this, um, Transatlantic Slate Trade, and we went from this table comparing, um, the Transatlantic Slate Trade, uh, to the familial system that existed in Africa, uh, prior to the European's arriving. The Europeans really are just going to, to build on to the slave system that the African States already have. Um, but they really fundamentally changed the nature of that slavery. The European version of slavery is very different than what African peoples had experienced prior to them. And this, this is a very famous picture, uh, about the transportation of an African, it's across the Atlantic to the Americas. Um, it is a very well known, well known picture. And the point of it is, I mean, these, these things in here, these are bodies laid, you know, head to toe, head to toe, you know, so they're, you know, they can stack them and they're stacked with people on these ships. These slave people are stacked like longer, like timber. Um, there's a tremendous amount of sickness and disease, death and dying on these ships. They are hellish, the conditions on them. These ships are hellish. Um, in terms of, of good depictions of the Transatlantic Slate Trade, in terms of movies, the best one that I can recall seeing, um, is on a movie called Amestog. Is anybody ever seen Amestog? Now, if you ever get the chance, Amestog's a very interesting story. You don't need to write this bit down, but if you're interested. So, um, that is, um, that is, is going to be, there's going to be a slave revolt on the ship, the slave state, the government ship, and basically sail it to the United States and try to seek their freedom. That way, saying that they're, uh, enslaved, it was actually no people at the time, which it was. Um, but it actually shows the conditions on the Transatlantic Slate Trade, um, the, the things that horrific, uh, experiences of the people that, that made it. There are estimates in this part of the world. There are, um, no one has a faithful 30%. And this was seen as an acceptable mortality rate. Sometimes when you're, when you're part of seeing something, where you're doing any kind of business, you know that there's a certain amount of, of waste, certain amount of, and I hate to refer to humans in that way. I'm only doing so because of how the slave owners themselves thought about. But like, when I, when I managed restaurants, there was always a certain level of food waste that was acceptable. You know, this many pounds of meat, you know, this is this many boxes of veggies that you could accept as, as, you know, waste that were built into your calculations. That is the way that slave traders viewed enslaved people on their ships. They're just good. And you know, there's an acceptable amount of, of death and waste on these trips. Then you could, you could handle and still turn a profit. And that is the point. The enslaved people are a commodity, they're a thing, they are an asset. And the fact that the death toll was so high. So often was just one of the things that you just got to deal with. You just have to accept this as a part of the, you know, the system. Now, in my notes, I never write transatlantic slave trade. I always write TASD and TASD always means transatlantic slave trade in my notes. So I don't have to write it out over and over and over again. The transatlantic slave trade lasted for the better part of three centuries. Really, you're talking about from the 1500s into the 1800s. And depending on the source, depending on the source, you'll find different ranges for how many people crossed the Atlantic. So I'm over between 11 and 16 million African peoples were transported. Now I have this specific map on here for a very specific reason. 11 to 16 million. I use this specific map not because it's the best representation, but there's something they show specifically on here that I really like. When you look at the flow of enslaved people across the Atlantic. The I've million. And I think that's the most important thing to do. To come to Brazil. Nearly that many people come to the Caribbean about four and a half to five million people come to the Caribbean. I think the number of enslaved peoples that come to the United States or what becomes the United States only half a million. Now half a million is nothing to, you know, to sneeze. I'm not going to do it. But when you look at the United States, we are this part of what you have in your notes. The United States is a minor. And secondary destination. The US is a minor and secondary destination. Today a lot of Americans we tend to think of ourselves as being the center of everything, the focus of everything, everything is about us. But when you talk about the transatlantic slave trade, the United States is not a major destination. The vast majority of enslaved peoples do not come to the United States. We are a minor destination. And we are a secondary destination. What I mean by that is the vast majority of the enslaved people. The enslaved people in the United States did not come directly from Africa. And that's what I like about this map. It's not just the numbers. It's the arrows here. There are very few American enslaved people that come directly from Africa. Most of the enslaved people that end up in the United States came to the United States from the West Indies, from the Caribbean. And that connection between the United States and the United States. Between the West Indies and America's Black communities is still that connection is still very present. I don't know if it's very present up here in Kentucky, nearly as much as it was in a parent in Florida when I was there. I mean, it seemed like half the Black population of Tallahassee were people that either had come directly over from the West Indies themselves or their parents. As Grandparents have, they're still eating tremendous amount of interaction between the Black communities. And from the very beginning, from the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, as you had African peoples being brought to the United States, they were almost always coming from the Caribbean, not directly from Africa. Now I mentioned this in the last class, but I do want to highlight this to make sure you all have it in your notes. This is the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, is a part of the global trade networks. This is a global trade network. And this map is actually kind of inaccurate, at least the way that historians teach it today. Today we'll talk about the triangle or trade. We talk about the quadrilateral trade. It's not just Europe to Africa to the Americas. It's Asia to Europe to Africa to the Americas, because a lot of the goods that the Europeans are bringing to Africa are things that they were getting from Asia, the luxury goods that we've been talking about so often in this class, things like silk and spices and tea. A lot of the goods that we've been talking about, that the Europeans are using our actions from Europe, they're from Asia. So this is truly a global trade network. They might need to recruit any of this. If you don't need to write numbers down from the slide or anything, I found this in a book that I was rather fond of years ago. I thought it was a good graphic to lay out here. When you're comparing the Muslim slave trade to the European slave trade, the Muslim slave trade is a massive number, 17 million probably in its history. At least that's what historians rounded out. So that is a massive number and probably right around as big as the European slave trade. The Muslim and the European slave trade are both massive and not just the European slave trade. But the European slave trade takes place over a much smaller time period. When you talk about the Muslim slave trade, you're talking about from a seventh century to the 20th century. It's more than two times longer, but about the same number of people. So when you talk about the European slave trade, you're talking about something that you can't even imagine. It takes a Muslim trade, but what we'll say is like this, the European trade is like this. It's a much, much bigger amount over a shorter period of time. The Europeans are going to take something that already exists. And they make it much, much bigger, much, much worse than it had ever been. Take a look at what's the crop that's the driving force behind the transatlantic trade? Good, sugar. It's good for this requirement. It is interesting. Sugar actually has a lot of cognates, I'm sorry, I think it's a lot of cognates, words that are similar across many, many different languages. They even sound a lot of life. The sugar colonies that the Portuguese develop in the eastern Atlantic are going to be the basis upon which the western Atlantic builds their sugar colonies. Now, one last thing I'm going to talk about here with the transatlantic slave trade before we move on. And this is, this next fit is based on the work of a slave trade. The European scholar of the transatlantic slave trade and an African history in general, we're about to be down the right. Yeah. Now I'll never ask you to name all the sugar colonies. Those are just examples anyway. So down the right is a scholar of Africa. And his thesis. This is a very important one for understanding the transatlantic slave trade. Because one of the questions that a lot of people have. One of the questions that a lot of people have about the transatlantic slave trade. Why would they do this? Why would Africans. So other Africans to the Europeans. Because it's not really a mystery. This is one of those the other things that I'm going to talk about. It's not a mystery to the different African peoples what's going on. Everybody knows that the transatlantic slave trade is really brutal, very deadly. But the people that survive it, survive it by dealing with really awful hell on earth kind of experiences. Everybody knows that this is about things. Why do they do it? In fact, there is a very famous scholar from Harvard called Henry Louis Gates. Very famous American, an African American scholar. And he's the one that does a lot of those. Those genetic shows where they like traced the genes of famous people and that afflexed it on their found that he was descended from slave owners and that kind of thing. Henry Louis Gates is a really famous historian. And we went to Africa. You did the series. This is maybe 30 years ago. Now that he did this series, it was a documentary on African history. And he was going throughout Africa, basically going to these places and showing the history that was there to an audience that generally doesn't know anything about history. And one of the questions he has is how could your people do this? How could your people have sold my people into slavery? And it's a question that is a really hard one for a lot of people to wrap their minds about. How can you know that? And you know that this stuff is going on and still do it. And Donald Wright has the best answer to that question. How could Africans do this to other Africans? How could you do this to other black people? Now, Donald Wright's thesis is, one, there are no tribes in Africa. Tribalism is actually a European construct. But when people talk about tribes in Africa, it's actually two. It's completely wrong if tribes don't exist. But also he argues that there's no such thing as an African. The African, the term African is kind of a bullshit term. All the way up into the 20th century. It's a fake identity, an imposed identity. The word African. Africa isn't even an African word. It's a European word. Term, Africa, and Africans, bullshit term. It doesn't actually represent anybody. The people that were described as Africans never would have described themselves that way. Think about it for you. How many of you, I don't want to ask that question. Let me ask you a different one. How many of you have ever been out of the country? How many people have been out of the country that were born here? When you go abroad, when you go to other areas of the world, how do you identify yourself? Where are you from? Yeah, you're American, right? How many people identify themselves? You would go to like, fucking, you know, Tim Buck too and West Africa. You go there, you're going to go see, they have actually a lot of really cool stuff in Tim Buck too. You go there and something, hey, where are you from? You're drinking a coffee because we're coffee shops. We're really popular. You go drink coffee, somebody's going to chat to you up, where are you from? Would you say I'm from an Owensboro? No. I think most of us are actually from Owensboro, but, you know, would you say I'm from Kentucky? Is that your primary identity? No, no, American is a lot of people in the United States. It's their primary identity. Even the people in this classroom who are not from the United States. When you identify yourself, do you identify yourself first by your hometown or by your nationality? You know, it's one of the script, but how many people in here would identify themselves as North American or Western Hemisphere? Technically, it's right. You know, I'm North American. Yeah, sure. Technically, that's right. But do you really share a sense of shared identity with people from other countries on the continent? Not really. Right? Like clearly, there's a difference between, you know, the United States and those non-agent Canadians, you know, with their hockey and their amazing beer and cold weather, curling, you know, I actually love Canada. I do love Canada. But, you know, you get the point. Like, you know, there's a separate identity there. You don't think of yourselves as North American or Western Hemisphere. Those are identities don't really have a meaning for you. Clearly, there is a different kind of identity from us. And, you know, Argentinians or Guatemalans or Canadians. For Africa, before the 20th century, the identity of African people does not work. They don't see themselves that way. They think they see themselves as ebo or kukuyu or even, you know, whatever their ethnic group is. That's how they identify themselves. They identify themselves as men, the way that we identify ourselves as American. So, it's an ethnic identity. Africa is not a real identity. And the only reason that the identity of African actually forms is as a defensive mechanism against European colonelists in the 20th century. It's only a response to external threats that create this sense of Africanness. It's not a shared identity. And so, when you look at this map, and this is this is great ethnic map of all the different ethnicities. You talk about the people that are enslaving other Africans. They don't see themselves as the same. There's no we. Us versus them. And that's called a phrase for that. I put my good marker. It's in phrase I want to be in your notes. There's all manners of evil that you can perpetrate on another group. When they are them. When you other of group. When you say that this is us. This is my people my circle. And everybody who was outside of that circle is a them. And that is at the root of a lot of the people that are in the group. There's a lot of evil in history. The lack. The lack of a shared identity. And us versus them mentality. For African peoples that enslaved other Africans. They didn't see those. Those people as as Africans. They didn't see them as us. The other than they saw them as a group entirely apart as aliens as foreigners. We. Turn. We. Doesn't include groups that we are enslaved. That's why the transatlantic slave trade worked. That's why the Europeans didn't actually need to go to the interior. To capture an enslaved African. The enslaved Africans were brought to them. But other groups that didn't see the enslaved really as people. As them. That's what they are. They're them. They're the other. They're the foreigners. African stone enslaved other Africans. Groups enslaved. Orators. Just like the differences between these ethnic groups are just as big as the differences between like the British and the French or the Germans and the Russians or Aryans versus Jews like it. You know, they're creating divisions in these groups are there they're recognizing divisions and these groups and saying we can do this to poor people because that's not us. You know, if a I don't know, a bus goes off a cliff in Pakistan was 400 people on it. Doesn't really register with most Americans. It becomes something of like a physics problem, right? Like, you know, how do they get 400 people on the bus? You know, that somebody must have been sick on some laps. You know, like it becomes like this abstract thing. It doesn't hit home. But if you change it. You change the location and you say, oh, there was a bus of college kids that they got driven off the road in a snow storm and Arkansas. Suddenly becomes more relevant to Americans when it's dust when it's our people, the people that we think of as we. That has mean what happens to them has me. And along the violence in this world, you know, even domestic violence or I'm saying domestic, I mean inside the US even even American violence towards other Americans. You'll get the root of it a lot of times. It's this other thing that takes place the violence against the groups. They're not us. They're, they're, you know, them. They're another. That lack of shared identity shared humanity is a lot of violence in this country and around the world. I'm going to talk about. Slavery in one part of Africa. There's actually three big zones of slavery in Africa during the transatlantic slavery of West Africa. Southern Africa and Eastern Africa. I said, Southern and Central, so West Central and Eastern. Those are the three big zones of the transatlantic slave trade. West Central and East. Are the three big zones of enslavement. We talk about the Portuguese. The Portuguese that were exploring Africa before all the other Europeans, we talk about Bosco, Nevada and these other explorers. By the 17. I'm sorry, by the 1490s. By the 1490s. The Portuguese have made it down to Central Africa. And one of the areas in Central Africa that they really focus on. Is on the Congo. Con. 1480s, 1490s. Yeah. So they get to Central Africa. And one of the areas they really deal with. They really focus on is on the Congo. Now Congo is a river basin in Central. It's actually in an area. There's actually not a ton of roads in Congo. A lot of the transportation and communication is done by this massive network of rivers throughout. Throughout the region. Now 1483. Portuguese relations with Congo begin. 1480s. And for a while, the trade that exists. Between Congo and the Portuguese. It's dominated by luxury. And the Europeans are bringing on a European and Asian luxury goods. Into Congo. So much so. That whichever members of the Congo aristocracy. Have the best trade relations with the Europeans. That, you know, that. That's more powerful. So I'll say that again, because it came out kind of janky. The Europeans, whoever they focused their trade on, whichever one members of the aristocracy were able to get the most luxury goods. That group. It came much more powerful in Congo. So the Europeans as soon as they arrived begin to affect the political climate in Congo. And that is really important. They begin to play favorites among the elites of Congo. The Portuguese had were so highly sought after. They were reshaping the politics of Congo. Raising some parts of the elites of. Over the others. Now this is 1483s when these relations begin. But by 1500. By 1500. The relationship changed. Between Congo and Portugal. And the reason it changes is because of those sugar plantations that we just caught their back. As the Portuguese begin to grow their sugar plantations. In the Atlantic. Portuguese begin to grow their sugar plantations from the Atlantic. Their interest in Congo turns. To the acquisition. Of slaves. Here be the. As the Portuguese colonies, the sugar plantations colonies in the Atlantic are growing. Portuguese focus in Congo changes. Instead of focusing on the luxury trade. They begin to focus on the slave trade. They need more slaves. To work the growing number of sugar plantations. And it seems. Like their appetite for slaves is insatiable. This is a really keep part of the transatlantic slave trade. When the Portuguese come into Congo, they tap into a slave system that already exists. Congo already has slavery. So they're not building anything new. The Europeans, the Portuguese, when they come in there. The encounter a slave trade system that already exists. But their demand for enslaved people. Is insatiable. There seems to be no end to it. If Congo. Had a slave population, we'll just drop the number of like a thousand people. The Europeans are demanding 100,000. You know what I'm saying? Like the number of slaves that the Europeans wants is vastly more. Than anything the people of Congo had ever encountered before. So the Europeans want to be a slave population. The Europeans take a slave system again with this graphic. They have a slave population in Congo. This much. And it grows slightly over the course of the century. What the Europeans want is vastly bigger than anything that Congo had ever had in terms of a demand for slaves. As they're developing more sugar plantations, the Portuguese demand for African slaves versus exponentially. All of the growth of sugar plantations. Goes from being about the luxury trade to being about the slave trade. Now what are the key figures in Portugal's relationship with Congo? Is a bond? The first. Fonds of the first is one of the key figures in the relationship between the Portuguese and the people of Congo. Now in the 1490s, he converts to Christianity. Now the conversion to Christianity is a very political move. He knows that as a Christian, the Portuguese will back him over non-Christians. His conversion to Christianity is very political. It's about gaining the favor of the Portuguese. It was trade so incredibly important to the elite of Congo. And using that, support by the Europeans in 1506, a foms up, those who are being at Prince to being the king, is now the ruler of Congo. And he is very eager. He's very eager to have a good relationship with the Portuguese knowing that their backing will make him stronger. He welcomes Christian missionaries. And welcomes Christian missionaries, the Christian merchants. Into the region. But. He actually hated slavery. He hated slavery. And thought that it was damaging Congo. Now this all works. This relationship works. And the beginning, when the focus of the Portuguese is on the luxury trade. But what he believes, what he comes to believe, a foms up comes to believe. And what he wants to believe is that conversion and trade are not the goals of the Portuguese. It wants to dominate the people of Congo. So that they can extract as many slaves as they need. He realizes after several decades already of Portuguese support, he realizes the Portuguese find out for strong relations with Congo. And so he reverses course. He begins to curb Portuguese power to live in Portuguese power. And to restrict the slavery. He tries to receive power. He tries to resist. And to restrict the Portuguese power. To limit the slave. They may need to be any of that. That's good. Anywhere. But it's trying to limit Portuguese power and limit the slave trade. Now his rivals. His rivals are going to use that to their advantage. Fonzos rivals are going to use. The two is to their advantage. His policies against the slave trade. His policies against Portuguese power. The two are rivals. They're going to exploit that. They are going to say we support slavery. We support Portuguese power in Congo. So that they will have the Portuguese back. Now when he dies in 1542. When he dies in 1542. His dynasty collapses. And the Portuguese are going to play off the different rivals for Fonzos for him against each other. In a struggle for a succession. So in 1542. When he dies. There's going to be a fight over who takes the throne. And the Portuguese. The best thing for the Portuguese is to have the elites of Congo fighting each other. If they're fighting each other. They're not focused on limiting Portuguese power. So basically the Portuguese are instigating. They're stoking. These rivals. And Congo is going to descend into civil war. For over a century. Following the death of a Fonzos. Congo is going to have a century of civil war. And that's entirely caused by the Portuguese and the slave trade. People today sometimes talk about, we have given the last president Donald Trump called, you know, we've started that shit poll countries and places that are politically unstable. Europeans and Westerners, you know, Americans that forget all the time. It's a lot of the instability was caused directly by the Europeans and the Americans. The slave trade. And the civil war that goes on to the Congo was directly caused, intentionally caused by the Portuguese. Benefiting from the instability. A century of civil war in Congo. And there's one last thing I want to focus on here before we move to the Americas for a bit. When we talk about African colonials and what I mean by the course is European colonialism in Africa. Before 1800, when you look at this math. One of the things that I hope you notice. Is that all the colonies, all the European colonies in Africa are on the coast. And that's the balance. These are the parts of Africa that have been colonized before 1800. Spanish up here in Morocco, the French, you know, in Western Africa. The British are kind of everywhere. The Germans are going to get on it. You know, you know, kind of late to the party. Even the French. The Belgians get on it. But when we look at all of these colonies, they're all on the exterior of Africa. And this goes back to that book that I read from in the last class of the diligent. The African people, these African states, they're too powerful for the Europeans to just come in and push their way around. The Europeans are kept on the periphery into the 19th century. It's only later. It's only after three centuries of European contact. The European states begin to put into the interior of Africa. And for the most part, the Europeans are getting everything they needed. By staying on the coast. They're going to be able to really enjoy the ocean. Up until the 1900s, Slyprin was the real only commodity that the Europeans were interested in. And it is no coincidence that this changes in the 1800s. In the 1800s, and I watch you put this in your nose, in the 1800s. The transit-lighted slave trade is going to be outlawed. The Europeans begin to get rid of it. And the reason they get rid of it is because they got all the slaves they need. They don't need anymore slaves. The Europeans begin to end the transit-lantic slave trade. Because they got all the slaves they needed. The Europeans begin to end the transit-lantic slave trade. Because they got the labor supply in the Americas that they need. Sometimes people portray this as like a moral thing. You talk about William Wilbur Force and the British abolitionist movement, things like that. The American abolitionist movement. Oh, slavery is not needed anymore. That's not why slavery ends when it ends. It's not the abolitionist movement. They never use slavery. It's not possible. It's sheer economics. Your Europeans have gotten slave labor supply that they need. They don't need Africa any more to supply cheap labor. And so they end the transit-lantic slave trade. Well, they've ended it. So what else is there for them to do in Africa? Why is there any interest there? Well, what happens in the 19th century is industrialization. In the 19th century, so the same century, the same century that the Europeans are ending the transit-lantic slave trade. They are also industrialized. And the reason that is important is that for industrialization to happen, you need a lot of natural resources. When during industrialization to happen in Europe, we need a lot of natural resources. Many natural resources are the way that people get to work on everything that's done and that is what we need. That is true. If your company is becoming both of the fluxes or the whole economy doesn't become, those natural resources are not available in Europe. That is what Africa becomes so much more interesting to Europeans. We don't need slave labor anymore. We need natural resources. That moment when the Europeans become interested in natural resources that they begin to push into the interior of Africa to grab a whole of the amazing natural resources in the interior of Africa. And they find that those things are better. They find that those things getting natural resources is better when you directly control the land. So you have the creation of colonies. Colleagues need interior of Africa. All about natural resources. You need it for industrialization. You need the natural resources in the interior for industrialization. Now I always write natural resources in my notes. This NR would be our circle. Don't know why I do that. Since I was in college, I was put NR with a circle around the R. I have natural resources. So every time I see that in my notes, that's what that means. That's what that means. That's what industrialization causes the need for natural resources. If that's what you do that, it's the sub colonies in the interior. It writes with me. Very good. And no, this is ruining stuff, but it is important. Okay. There's another part of this industrialization equation. It's not just natural resources. They want. They also want markets. They also want to make sure that they are not only natural resources, but they are industrial goods. What do you mean by that? Is the Europeans want people that will buy the stuff that they're making in their factories? Not only are the Europeans extracting natural resources, but they're selling their industrial goods. They're manufacturing goods back to the Africa. We want colonies so that we can extract the natural resources and that we can force them to buy our stuff. We talk about the colonial system. The Europeans create in Africa. One of the legacies of colonialism in Africa is the development of unbalanced or one-dimensional economies. One-dimensional or unbalanced economies. Colonial economies are infurently unbalanced. The point of a colonial economy, are these two things, natural resources, and a market for the colonial powers goods. This means that the colonial economy is focused on delivering those two things to the empire and nothing else. If you're an economy that provides sugar to the empire, and once you grow in a bunch of other stuff, if you're an economy that is a sugar colony, any farmland that isn't producing sugar is wasted. What ends up happening a lot of times in sugar colonies is the farmland is so focused on producing sugar or whatever cash drop you have, that a lot of times those colonies are susceptible to starvation. Not because people don't know how much of a farm, not because the farmland has suddenly gone bad, but because the farmland isn't being used to grow crops that you need to survive. Instead, what happens to you have a colony, let's stick with the sugar colony example, the sugar colony is going to grow sugar and nothing else. And all of the crops that you need to feed yourself are going to be imported from the empire. It's a very unbalanced economy. Now, if you have a sugar plantation economy, do you need to have a diverse economy? Like, you need not just sugar production, but industry or things like that. No, no. A colonial economy is also going to stunt the natural growth of locally. And this is the reason that when you look at Africa today, when you look at the economies of Africa today, that so many of them struggle because of the legacy of colonialists, these economies that are so focused on selling specific goods to the empire become dependent on the empire for things like industrial goods, economies are unbalanced, and many of them have struggle to grow. And this is important for you to know, it's decolonization in many areas of Africa is less than a century old. There were parts of Africa that were only decolonized in the 1970s and 80s. You're talking about, when you talk about the 1980s, you're talking about 40 years ago, that's not a long time when we talk about decolonization and the legacy of these one-dimensional economies, there's still a ceiling with it. It's not over, it's just a thousand years ago, it's not a hundred years, you're 40 years. It's within my lifetime in some areas. These unbalanced, one-dimensional economies have shaped the world that we live in today. But there is a glimmer of hope. When you talk about African economies, there is a glimmer of hope. And it lies with something that I mentioned on the first day of class. In the 1400s, if you had to take bets on which area of the world would it be the strongest or the next thousand years? Nobody would have picked your. A lot of times, the areas that rise up to be a center of power. A lot of times, they seemingly come out of nowhere. There's no reason to expect that 500 years from now that Africa will still be in the world. It's not in that position because of its own doing, it's in that position because of external powers. Thousand years from now, it might be Africa that is the most powerful region in the world. I'm going to take a page out of the condo forever, something that can create a impact for comparison. That is the rival of the United States today. All right. We are really continuing to talk about the world. We talked about Africa in this course. There are going to be several times that we touched on it. But I am going to move now to talk about the Europeans in the Americas, specifically Central and South America. So when we talk about the development of the Americas, it is always important to remember that it was kind of a mistake. Remember that Columbus, when he finds the Caribbean, he wasn't expecting it. But when he gets to the Caribbean, he starts to refer to the people as Indians. He refers to the Caribbean as the West Indies. He believes that he's gotten to the outer islands near India. He doesn't realize that he's discovered an entirely new continent. He doesn't understand that there's this massive land mass in between his goal of India and China. He thinks that he's found Indians. And the development of European power in the Americas is kind of ad hoc. Do you guys know that phrase ad hoc? It's just kind of, it's a Latin phrase. It's kind of like, we're going to talk about the world. We're rolling with the punches. Just doing it as you go. You're making it up as you go along. Ad hoc is sometimes a response to necessity, right? When we encounter things you weren't expecting, you have this ad hoc approach. Go with it. Do the best you can in that situation. But there means that there's no central planning. And I do want you to have that in your notes. For the Europeans in the Americas, there is no central planning. They didn't intentionally set out to conquer the Americas. It almost happens outside of their intention, outside of their control. Europeans never went over and intended to conquer the Americas to create massive plantations and colonies and things like that. There was no centralized planning. They're just dealing with the situation as it developed. And so there's a lot of incoherence. There's a lot of just contradictory movements. Every kind of throwing stuff on the wall and hoping something will stick. Is no intentional plan to colonize the Americas. It almost happens by accident in a way. Now the main power. The main power. The main power in the Americas and the 1500s is the Spanish. The main power in the Americas and the 1500s is the Spanish. Which makes sense when you think about it, right? Like the Spanish are going to come to the Americas first with Columbus. He's the first of the European explorers. When you look at the European goals for the Americas, once they realize, okay, this isn't Asia. This is something new and unexpected. I've got that song from a cotton cow now. My head something new and unexpected. They encounter this new and unexpected land mass and the West. And they're going to develop some goals in response to that. The first of their goals is agricultural expansion. And which crop do you think drives that agricultural expansion? Definitely sure. Like the Portuguese, the Spanish won't be able to do that. But you break the monopoly.\n"
